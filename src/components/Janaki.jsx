                It is an example of mixed Islam and Hindu Nepali architecture.
                It is often considered the most important model of Mughal
                architecture in Nepal. The Mandir (Temple) is popularly known as
                the Nau Lakha Mandir (meaning "nine lakhs"). The cost for the
                construction of the temple was about the same amount of money:
                rupees nine lakhs or nine hundred thousand, hence the name.
                Queen Vrisha Bhanu of Tikamgarh built the temple in 1910 AD. The
                site was designated as a UNESCO tentative site in 2008.

                In 1657, a golden statue of the Goddess Sita was found at the
                very spot, and Sita is said to have lived there. The legend said
                it that it was built on the holy site where Sannyasi
                Shurkishordas had found the images of Goddess Sita. In fact,
                Shurkishordas was the founder of modern Janakpur and the great
                saint and poet who preached about the Sita Upasana (also called
                Sita Upanishad) philosophy. Legend has claimed it that King
                Janak(Seeradhwaj) performed the worship of Shiva-Dhanus on this
                site.
